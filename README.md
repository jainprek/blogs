<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For my Writing 50 class last quarter, I was required to write a blog post entry every week. We compiled ten blog posts and made a website portfolio through the platform Wix. Attached is one of my blog entries.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;p2&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hi! My name is Preksha Jain and I am a freshman at the University of California, Irvine. I recently introduced myself in my Writing 50 class through a presentation in six words.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have lived in California my entire life, being raised in the Bay Area and now pursuing a BA in Business Economics in Irvine. I am the first in my family to attend college in the United States which has provided this journey with many more surprises than I would have ever anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I consider myself to be an analytical and creative thinker. I am passionate about an assortment of subjects. My favorite genre to read is murder mystery, favorite math subject is statistics and my field of interest is business management. In eleventh grade, I combined my favorite interests to create a talent show based off of a murder mystery for a business organization called DECA. We titled the show “Who Did It? A MurDECA Mystery.”As one of my favorite events till date, this experience helped me to realize that I want to pursue a career in which I can apply my analytical, creative, and management skills.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Outside of academics, my family is a huge part of my life. I have a younger brother whose value I did not truly appreciate until moving to college 350 miles away. I rely on my parents’ support to motivate me and guide my decisions to be successful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;b&gt;PREVIOUS WRITING EXPERIENCE&lt;/b&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The last English course I completed was African American Literature during my senior year of high school. The purpose of this class was to involve students in a different perspective of literature. Many English classes focus on the mainstream stories, predominantly by Caucasian authors with similar characters, while this class focused on the minority voices and writing pieces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Personally, I improved my writing skills and became more cognizant of combining different perspectives which I hope to apply in Writing 50 this quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;b&gt;SELF-ASSESSMENT&lt;/b&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I believe my writing and communication skills are strong enough to get my point across and after several revisions can exceed the standards however I do struggle with using the most concise language to help my writing flow.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a reader, I believe that if the material interests me, then I can complete hundreds of pages in one sitting. However, if I feel compelled to read and I do not enjoy it, my mind wanders and it takes a more cognizant approach to understand the message.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am comfortable with reading complicated texts on topics that fascinate me. I struggle when the language is overly complex, but rereading and using a metacognitive approach helps me to understand the material better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I read a variety of texts, ranging from news articles to novels. National Geographic is a valuable network for me. From a young age I read both the kids and regular versions and found that the stories of people and animals from all over the world intrigued me because I learned about the different cultures and lives of people from all over the world. This magazine also introduced me to the world of nature photography and inspired me to maintain my own photo journals and capture the world around me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of my favorite novels is a book I read in eighth grade, One of Us Is Lying by Karen McManus. This book introduced me to the mystery genre and sparked my love for reading as a teenager.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of my communication issues lie in creative mental blocks and unable to understand the text. Sometimes taking a break and revisiting a text with a fresh mind helps me to come up with better ideas for writing and process a text for reading.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have improved in my ability to write essays, especially ones with prompts such as symbolism analysis. In my African American Literature class, the second essay we wrote was one of the most successful essays for me, as I was able to better understand the expectations and grading standards and adjust my work accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;b&gt;CORE ELEMENTS&lt;/b&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;div&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Writing 50 class at UCI has several crucial introductory materials including the syllabus, course objectives, and grade contract. The syllabus explains the basis of the course and how the goal is to improve in skills such as analysis and purposeful writing. We are also informed about the logistics of this course, including our readings and attendance requirements. The course objectives cover the two main essays of the quarter as well as using critical reading strategies to support thinking. These also discuss the ability to transfer our skills to new genre and rhetoric outside of Writing 50. Finally, the grade contract examines the breakdown of what we can expect in terms of reading and writing standards. By completing all tasks and meeting requirements, we can earn a “B.” By excelling and going above and beyond we can earn “buffs” and by not meeting standards we can earn a “ding.” These points can help to improve and demote our grade.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I hope you enjoyed reading my first blog post as I embark on this new journey! I hope to grow my reading and writing skills in this class and look forward to bringing you along. I am excited to enter a new world!</span></p>
